ACME CORP ENGINEERING HANDBOOK
Version 3.2 — Last Updated: September 2025

=== CHAPTER 1: COMPANY OVERVIEW ===

Acme Corp was founded in 2018 by Dr. Sarah Chen and Marcus Rivera in Austin, Texas. What began as a small consulting firm has grown into a mid-size technology company with over 350 employees across three offices: Austin (HQ), Denver, and Toronto.

Our mission is to build reliable, scalable infrastructure tools that empower development teams worldwide. We specialize in cloud-native solutions, developer tooling, and enterprise automation platforms.

Acme Corp went through Series A funding in 2020, raising $12 million from Horizon Ventures. In 2022, we closed our Series B at $45 million, led by Cascade Capital with participation from TechForward Fund. As of Q3 2025, annual recurring revenue (ARR) has reached $28 million.

=== CHAPTER 2: ENGINEERING ORGANIZATION ===

The engineering department is led by CTO Marcus Rivera and is organized into five teams:

1. Platform Team (12 engineers) — Owns core infrastructure, Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, and observability stack. Led by Principal Engineer James O'Brien.

2. Backend Team (18 engineers) — Develops APIs, microservices, and data processing pipelines. Primary tech stack: Python, Go, PostgreSQL, Redis. Led by Engineering Manager Priya Sharma.

3. Frontend Team (10 engineers) — Builds web applications and developer dashboards. Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js. Led by Engineering Manager David Kim.

4. Machine Learning Team (8 engineers) — Develops ML models for anomaly detection, log analysis, and intelligent alerting. Tech stack: Python, PyTorch, MLflow. Led by ML Lead Dr. Ana Santos.

5. Quality Engineering Team (6 engineers) — Owns test automation, performance testing, and release validation. Led by QE Manager Tom Walsh.

Total engineering headcount: 54 engineers plus 4 engineering managers and 1 CTO.

=== CHAPTER 3: DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES ===

Code Review Policy:
All code changes require at least two approving reviews before merging to the main branch. One reviewer must be from the same team, and for changes affecting shared libraries, a review from the Platform team is also required. Reviews should be completed within one business day.

Branching Strategy:
We follow a trunk-based development model. Feature branches should be short-lived (no more than 3 days). All branches must pass CI checks before merge. Release branches are cut every two weeks on Wednesdays.

Testing Requirements:
- Unit test coverage must remain above 80% for all services.
- Integration tests are required for all API endpoints.
- End-to-end tests must pass in the staging environment before any production deployment.
- Performance regression tests run nightly and block releases if P95 latency increases by more than 10%.

Deployment Process:
Deployments follow a blue-green strategy. New releases are first deployed to the canary environment (5% of traffic) for 30 minutes. If error rates remain below 0.1%, traffic is gradually shifted to the new version over 2 hours. Rollbacks are automated and trigger if error rates exceed 0.5%.

=== CHAPTER 4: TECHNOLOGY STACK ===

Backend Services:
- Languages: Python 3.11, Go 1.21
- Frameworks: FastAPI (Python), Gin (Go)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15 (primary), Redis 7 (caching), ClickHouse (analytics)
- Message Queue: Apache Kafka
- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS on AWS)

Frontend:
- Framework: Next.js 14 with React 18
- Language: TypeScript 5.2
- State Management: Zustand
- UI Components: Custom design system built on Radix UI
- Testing: Vitest + Playwright

Infrastructure:
- Cloud Provider: AWS (primary), with disaster recovery on GCP
- IaC: Terraform
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Alerting: PagerDuty integration with custom alert rules

=== CHAPTER 5: SECURITY POLICIES ===

All engineers must complete annual security training. The security review checklist must be completed for any feature that handles user data, authentication, or external integrations.

Key policies:
- All secrets must be stored in AWS Secrets Manager. Hard-coded secrets in repositories will trigger an automatic block.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is mandatory for all internal systems.
- Production database access requires approval from two senior engineers and is logged with full audit trail.
- Penetration testing is conducted quarterly by an external firm (currently CyberShield Inc.).
- Incident response follows the NIST framework. On-call rotation covers all teams 24/7.

Data Classification:
- Level 1 (Public): Marketing materials, blog posts, open-source code
- Level 2 (Internal): Engineering docs, internal tools, sprint data
- Level 3 (Confidential): Customer data, financial reports, security audit results
- Level 4 (Restricted): Encryption keys, access credentials, PII

=== CHAPTER 6: ONBOARDING ===

New engineer onboarding takes two weeks and includes:

Week 1:
- Day 1: Laptop setup, account provisioning, welcome session with HR
- Day 2: Engineering orientation with CTO Marcus Rivera
- Day 3-4: Development environment setup, first "good first issue" PR
- Day 5: Team lunch and 1:1 with direct manager

Week 2:
- Day 6-7: Deep dive into team's codebase with assigned buddy
- Day 8: Security training and compliance overview
- Day 9: First on-call shadow session
- Day 10: Onboarding retrospective and 30/60/90 day goal setting

Every new engineer is assigned a buddy from their team for the first 90 days. The buddy is responsible for daily check-ins during week 1, and weekly check-ins thereafter.
